1. How might we ensure relationship managers are serving suitable customers?
2. How might we provide RMs with appriopraite resources such as customer information?
3. How might we store and use customer information to provide an improved service?
4. How might we reduce per-call handling?
5. How might we ensure an appropriate call flow rate ?
6. How might we ensure employees are allocated tasks within their expertise after initial hire and over time?
